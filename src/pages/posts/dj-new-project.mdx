description: Getting started with a new Django project involves making a new virtual environment, installing Django and some other boilerplate commands. Learn how to get up and running.  
---

Start by setting up and activating a [virtual environment](./py-venv). Then carry on with the steps below:

## Install and make project and app

```bash
python -m pip install django
django-admin startproject mysite
python manage.py startapp blog  
```

## Register, run, create admin user

To register app in settings.py add:

```
[name of app].apps.[name of app]BlogConfig
```

You will need a superuser so you can access the Django admin system. This command will take you through creating one.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You are now ready to start the Django server and get started.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Getting to know the api 

Checking out this [great summary of all flexbox options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94&t=241s) that helped me tremendously.
The same channel has in my opinion the most concise CSS Flexbox and Grid explanations

Also check [Josh Comeau's great CSS and JS articles](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/tutorials/css/) for in-depth information.

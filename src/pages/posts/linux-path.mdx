description: How to add to the path in Linux mint and also make functional in VSCODE    
---

I had installed node.js and now needed to add the bin directory to the path.  

Make hidden files visible by pressing CTRL h.
Open the file .bashrc and add this line to the end:  
  `export PATH=/home/david/NodeJS/bin:$PATH`
Save and make hidden files invisible again with CTRL h

I noticed that after Node JS install npm and node were not in the path when running VSCode terminal. To add it I did this:

I copied PATH from Linux terminal (Echo $PATH)
Then copied it to VSCode settings (CTRL ,) and: `Terminal › Integrated › Automation Profile: Linux`

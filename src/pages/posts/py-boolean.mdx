## Testing if a variable is empty

This is useful if you want to check form contents

```py
# Assuming your string variable is named 'text_variable'
text_variable = "   "  # Example: contains only whitespace characters

# Boolean expression to check if 'text_variable' is not blank
is_not_blank = text_variable and not text_variable.isspace()

# Print the result
print(is_not_blank)
```

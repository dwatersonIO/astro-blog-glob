By default, grub will boot item 0. Thus to change the boot order, you need to define the number of items you want to boot by default in the grub configuration file /etc/default/grub.
Change grub boot order   

To change the boot order, prioritize a different OS or kernel configuration edit the file /etc/default/grub using any text editor you want. You can edit it using nano, as shown in the example below. Remember, you need superuser privileges to edit the grub configuration file.

```
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Change the default number (index starts at 0). Then update grub by executing sudo update-grub as shown below.

```
sudo update-grub
```

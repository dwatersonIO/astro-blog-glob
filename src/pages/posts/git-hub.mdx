## Introduction

Good to remember that Git is the version control system and GitHub is a web solution to keep repositories (repos) in a centralized location


## First Initialize New GIT Project 

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m “my changes”
git branch -M main
```

## Making a New Repo 

First make the repo on GitHub then add the remote origin as below:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/[github username]/[repo-name].git
```
Now we can push the files to the GitHuB repo. First check what the current `origin` is set to. Note: `origin` is just term used by convention to represent the remote location:
```
git remote -v
```
If that confirms you are using the remote repo (origin) you intended then you can push the changed files there:
```
git push -u origin main
```

If you have no `origin` set then you specify it as follows:    
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/github username]/[repo-name].git
```


## Making Another Commit

Often you will be pushing files frequently to the same repo. So if you have checked the `origin` is correct, then for each update use the following commands.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m “my other changes”
git push
```

## Cloning a Repo from GitHub

Copy the url for the repo in GitHuB. Make an empty folder where you want to place the project then:    
`git clone https://github.com/[git username/[name of repo] .`

Notice the period at the end. This will ensure the clone command does not command a subfolder with the name of the repo. For this to work you need to have an empty folder. Then setup you virtual enviroment as normal.

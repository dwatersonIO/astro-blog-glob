## A video that will help you

Compliments to Web Dev Simplified for this [succinct video on the JS array methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8rmfD9Y5-c).

## Here is an example of the map function

```js
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(map1);
expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]
```

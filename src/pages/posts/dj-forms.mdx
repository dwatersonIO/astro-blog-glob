In our example we will use a form to process a data query or search. The simplest way to to use a basic HTML form as shown below. The `name` attribute is important since it will be references in our Django view

## First Way: Use a simple HTML form
```html
<!-- template -->
<input  type="search" placeholder="Search notes..." name="searched">
<button type="submit">Search</button> 
```
Then setup your logic in the `views.py` form

```python
# views.py
if request.method == "POST":
    searched = request.POST['searched'] # searched is the name attribute of the HTML form
    # In this example we will filter the Note.text database field for the search text
    notes = Note.objects.filter(text__contains=searched)
    return render(request, 'notes/search_note.html', {"searched":searched, "notes": notes})
```


## Second and Better Way

Use the Django form functionality to refer to the form in the template and then submit the data to the backend. This option does not depend on using the `name` attribute.
```python
# template
<form method="post" name="search_text" action="{% url 'search_note' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.text }}
    {{ form.type }}
    <button type="submit">Search</button> 
</form>
```
Then setup the logic to process the form. 

```python
# views.py
def search_note(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form=NoteForm(request.POST) # create an instance of the form sent
        if form.is_valid():
            searched=form.cleaned_data["text"]
            notes = Note.objects.filter(text__contains=searched)	

    else: # if this was a GET request then load empty form and send all data to the template
        notes = Note.objects.all().order_by('-date_created')
        form=NoteForm()

return render(request, 'notes/search_note.html', {"form": form, "notes": notes})
```

## Searching and Model forms

When deciding on a form to have the enter data into a form it seems best to use the ModelForm class. This model form will then use the same fields as specified in the model which is usually what you want.

The Model form will have fields that are required for data entry. But for searching you may not wish to force the user to search on every field. So in this case it is I created another form for searching only.


But in my example shown below I only wanted the user to have to search on the Summary field. I did not want to force the user to have to enter or select a search data in the Tags or Text fields. After checking the Django documentation on how to modify the ModelForm to do this I concluded in the end a simpler solution for this use case was to set up a search form called NoteSearchForm separately as shown below. Obviously you then need to update your 'views.py' accordingly.

```python
from django import forms
from django.forms import ModelForm
from notes.models import Note, Tag

class NoteForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Note
        fields = ['summary','text','tags']
        widgets = {
            'tags': forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple 
        }

class NoteSearchForm(forms.Form):
    summary = forms.CharField(required=False)
    text = forms.CharField(required=False)
    tags = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Tag.objects.all(), required=False, widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple) 
```
    
Now the ```views.py``` will look like this:
```python
def search_note(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':

		form=NoteSearchForm(request.POST)
		
		if form.is_valid():
			summary=form.cleaned_data["summary"]
			text = form.cleaned_data["text"]
			tags = form.cleaned_data["tags"]

		# Start with an empty queryset
		notes = Note.objects.all()

		# Filter based on submitted data
		if summary:
			notes = notes.filter(summary__icontains=summary)
		if text:
			notes = notes.filter(text__icontains=text)
		if tags:
			notes = notes.filter(tags__in=tags)
			
		form=NoteSearchForm()	

	else:
		notes = Note.objects.all().order_by('-date_created')
		form=NoteSearchForm()
		
	return render(request, 'notes/search_note.html', {"form": form, "notes": notes})
```

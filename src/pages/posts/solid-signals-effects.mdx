## Signals-Getters and Setters

Notice that `count` and `setCount` are not values but functions.  The createSignal has a starting value of 0

```js
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  setInterval(() => setCount(count() + 1), 1000);

  return <div>Count: {count()}</div>;
}
```
## Effects

Sometimes you will want a signal to be used in  more than one place. For example imagine I wanted to use the `count()` getter in another place in my code. For this we can implement `createEffect`. This is needed because the component only renders once. So `createEffect` will create an observable and will trigger what is called a side effect.

In example below we want to update `count()` in the console also. For this we need to use `createEffect` as shown below:

```js
import { createSignal, createEffect } from 'solid-js';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  createEffect(() => {
    console.log("The count is now", count());
  });

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>Click Me</button>;
}

render(() => <Counter />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

If we were to take out the `createEffect` function then the console would only update the count once, when the component first loads. Wrapping it in `createEffect` ensures the reactity is transferred to the console log. 

## Derived Signals
Sometimes this are called computed values in other frameworks.
In the example below you can see an example of a `derived signal` used to double the value of count.

```js
import { createSignal, createEffect} from "solid-js";

export default function Counter2() {
    const[count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
    const doubleCount = () => count() * 2;

    createEffect(() => {
        console.log("The count is now: ", count())
        })
    return (
        <div>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count()+1)}>Click Me:{count}</button>
        <p>Double count is: {doubleCount()}</p>
        </div>
    )
    }
  ```
